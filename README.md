# livre-or
My second project in php.

This project consisted of creating a guestbook with a profile modification, adding comments and creating an account.

I created a fake establishment by taking inspiration from a restaurant.

I did this using firefox, so it will be more responsive with this browser.

(Please forgive my bad english)

Guillaume.
